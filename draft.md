# Career Trajectory Presentation

###### Disclaimers

1. These materials are not for everyone. You may have differing opinions to some of these points, and that is totally okay!
2. The content and images in this presentation do _not_ claim to be an exact science. They are simple visualizations that attempt to illustrate the ideas, but should not be referenced as a canonized document.
3. We are going to talk about the skills needed to progress in our careers, and will tie those skills to various positions in the industry. It is important to note that the relationship between skills and roles is not 1:1, every role needs every skill to some degree.

## Constraints

- 45 minutes

## Goals / Deliverables

- Developers understand what opportunities exist in the industry
- Developers see what opportunities exist at GuideCX _today_, and what _could_ exist in the future
- Establish a shared language and understanding to help the Company and Developers maintain a more mutually-beneficial relationship
- Developers can identify problems to solve _today_ that will help them practice and develop skills needed to subclass the way they want

## Why?

- It is hard to learn about these opportunities because nobody teaches it. You generally learn by being in the industry for a few years
- You deserve to spend your life doing what makes you happy, and what excites you
- Although the titles don't currently exist at GuideCX, the opportunities and needs do; It is up to us to take advantage of them
- We all want GuideCX to be a safe place to experiment, explore, and learn, and we need to act like it is

# Outline

- Overview of Goals
  - Expectations for the presentation
  - Answer "Why" questions
- What is a Career Developer?
  - Richard Hamming "You and Your Research"
- To take the reins of your career and craft it into something that fulfills you, you must first understand the possibilities
- What roles exist today in the Software Engineering industry?
  <!-- Show Roles chart and discuss in an open-panel what the different roles do -->
  - What does a person in X position do?
  - What skills are needed to do X job?
  - What specializations exist within a given role?
    - EG `Software Engineer 2` has Accessibility, Mobile, Web, Platform, Systems, API, etc
  - What if I don't want to specialize / What if I want to generalize?
- What roles exist today at GuideCX, and what _could_ our team look like in the future?
  <!-- Show grayed-out Roles chart to show what positions we currently have -->
  - Even though many of the listed roles/titles don't currently exist, the needs (and jobs to be done) do
    - We are already doing many of the things done by a DBA, an Architect, a Technical Recruiter, etc
  - As GuideCX grows, more of these roles will begin to open up. Nobody knows when, or which roles, but until that point, we have the opportunity to try on many of the different hats to see what we enjoy, to practice these skills, and to learn in a safe environment
  - When these positions _do_ open up, if we have practiced these skills, we will have a track record that we can use as a `brag doc` to showcase why we are the best candidate for the role.
- (meme) How is an organization with lots of progamers structured?
  <!-- Show an image of an E-Sports team because lol -->
- (meme cont.) sorry, typo... How is an organization with lots of *programmers* structured?
