# Career Trajectory

# Disclaimers

<Narrow styleOverrides={{ textAlign: 'left' }} >

<Steps>

1. Parts of this presentation were written with the help of CoPilot... Bloopers at the end.

2. You may have different opinions to the points I hope to make today. That is great!

3. The ideas in this presentation do _not_ claim to be exact or complete. They are simply visualizations that attempt to illustrate the ideas, but should not be taken as a guarantee of the future of the company.

4. I will be talking about the skills needed to progress in our careers, and will relate those skills to various positions in the industry and company; The relationship between these skills and roles is not 1:1. Every role needs every skill to some degree.

# Goals of this Discussion

<Narrow styleOverrides={{ textAlign: 'left' }} >

<Steps>

1. Developers understand the opportunities that exist in the industry

2. Developers understand what opportunities exist at GuideCX _today_, and what opportunities exist in the future

4. Developers can identify problems to solve _today_ that will help them practice the skills they need to achieve their career goals

</Steps>

# Why?

---

<Narrow width="70%">

### It is hard to learn about these opportunities because nobody teaches it. You generally learn by being in the industry for a few years.

</Narrow>

---

<Narrow width="70%">

### We all deserve to spend our lives doing what makes us happy, what excites us, and what fulfills us.

</Narrow>

---

<Narrow width="70%">

### Although the titles don't currently exist at GuideCX, the `needs` do, so we have the ability practice our skills now to prepare us for when opportunities arise here or elsewhere.

</Narrow>

<Narrow width="70%">

###### (I gagged a little by how cheesy that was, but I do actually believe it, so it stays)

</Narrow>

---

<Narrow width="70%">

### GuideCX should be a safe place to experiement, explore, and learn, but there are things we have to do to get it there.

</Narrow>

## If we want to craft our careers into something that fulfills us, we first need to understand what is possible.

</Narrow>

---

<IMG src={grouped_roles} />

<Notes>

### As a group, discuss some of the following:

- What does a person in X position do?
- What skills are needed to do X job?
- What specializations exist for X role?
  - EG `Software Engineer 2` has Accessibility, Mobile, Web, Platform, Systems, API, Security, etc.
- What if I don't want to specialize? / What if I want to generalize?

### What roles exist today at GuideCX?

### What _could_ our team look like in the future?

</Narrow>

---

<IMG src={grouped_roles_gray} />

<Notes>

- We are currently doing the job of all of these roles, we just have generalists doing them instead of specialists.
- As we start to grow, many of these jobs will start to be unlocked. Nobody knows when that will happen, or which roles will open when, but its incredibly unreasonable to say they won't.
  - Until that point, we each have the opportunity to try on all of those hats to see what we enjoy and to practice those skills.
- When those positions _do_ open up, if we have tackled some of these problems, we will have a track record that we can use as a `brac doc` to showcase why we are the best candidate for the job. We can claim ownership of our career.

# Conclusion

<Notes>

There are _so many_ opportunities to learn, practice, and create the career that we want for ourselves. All of the conversations that we have about studying, picking up a ball and running with it, and being hired to solve problems (not just identify them) are because we have _so many_ resources to do the things we want to do, but we have to be the ones to actually do something about it.
